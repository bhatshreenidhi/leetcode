/* Longest consecutive sequence
	
Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

For example,
Given [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2],
The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Return its length: 4.

Put all these into a set.
At each variable, try traversing toward the left and to the right, removing its consecutive elements from the set and counting the total elements.
Take a global counter that is maximum.
